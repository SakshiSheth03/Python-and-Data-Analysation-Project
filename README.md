# Titanic_Survivors_Analysis
Welcome to the Titanic Survivor Analysis project repository!
This python based project is aimed at unveiling survival patterns among Titanic passengers.
The conclusion is drawn by analyzing multiple parameters, including gender, ticket fare, ticket class, age, presence of family members, and port of boarding.
Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are utilized for statistical analysis on a CSV data file.
